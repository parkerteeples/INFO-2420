<h2>Questions</h2>

	<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
	<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
	<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
	<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>

<h2>Website 1 Critique - https://www.traderjoes.com/home</h2>

<ol>
	<li>It felt like I was opening a site for a cooking recipe with the amount of different items that I could see from just the first page.</li>
	<li>The Scheme felt like a presentation with the amount it changes.</li>
	<li>It Makes sense in a way that I could find anything if needed, but also the choices on the front felt like they were trying too hard to stand out.</li>
	<li>The graphics of the site make it feel like a cookbook and I think that is exactly what they were going for.</li>
	<li>It was way faster compared to a lot of other sites. It only took barely a second.</li>
	<li>The text color and size were a very generic font in black, so very easy to read. The only time the background wasn't white it was a cardboard color, so I think it wasn't very distracting.</li>
	<li>It had a navigation bar and a search bar, so there was no getting lost in this site.</li>
	<li>It had a paper scheme, like a lot of the images were drawn by a pencil and a few lined paper backgrounds.</li>
	<li>It did very well and adapted to all shapes except for the top segment where the image would sometimes cover the text.</li>
	<li>They knew where to put their information so that it was easily accessible from when you immediately opened the site.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Website 2 Critique - https://pitchfork.com/</h2>

<ol>
	<li>When I first opened the site it felt like I was being bombarded by the amount of information that was shoved on one page.</li>
	<li>The biggest headline was in the middle, with recent news on the right, and other big stories on the left. When you scrolled down it was just a bunch of reviews.</li>
	<li>The structure makes sense in way a that they are trying to fit as many stories on one page as possible.</li>
	<li>There were very little graphics so you pay attention to the stories and not the site. That was the same for the layout.</li>
	<li>A few seconds, not bad, but not the fastest.</li>
	<li>I would say they are reasonable, but barely bigger than the headlines. The background was all white so not much to comment on that.</li>
	<li>They had a basic navigation bar that could be expanded, and a search bar.</li>
	<li>Black and white, like a newspaper.</li>
	<li>Yes, but it jumped around a bit when you shrank or expanded it.</li>
	<li>It was very a basic site overall. Nothing too interesting.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Website 3 Critique - https://sabletine.com/index.html</h2>

<ol>
	<li>I was a little confused on why we were going to an index html but it makes sense looking at it now.</li>
	<li>They have all their links placed on the top below the name of the store, and when you clicked one of the links it had information below an image that changed between a set of images.</li>
	<li>It confused me because it has an unnecessary amount of buttons and pages that are on one page.</li>
	<li>The only graphics they had was a simple image. Besides that, it was very bland.</li>
	<li>Near instant, like confusingly fast.</li>
	<li>All the text was fine except for the main heading that had an unreadable cursive font.</li>
	<li>It had a super basic navigation bar, but to actually go to the shop you had to click the giant pink box on the side.</li>
	<li>Very bland, just white.</li>
	<li>If made too small it just stops shrinking with the window.</li>
	<li>The navigation bar really just led to pages that explained the type of food they had.</li>
